# pairing-best-practices

## Set Expectations
- What are your goals? (What do you want to learn?)
- When will you take breaks? (Breaks are important!)
- How do you want to drive and navigate? (Do you adhere to the strict rules or allow them to blur?)
- Decide how often to switch (we recommend 20 minute intervals)

## Ask for Feedback
- At the end of the session, review what you learned
- Talk about ways you could do things better 
- Provide specific feedback (When you do x, this makes me do y. Could you try doing z?)

## Yes and...
- Agree to ask questions
- Be open to questions
- If in doubt, give it a try.
